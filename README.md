We developed LDSeg-DeepLabV3+, a lightweight yet powerful deep segmentation model intended for effective leaf disease detection, as a solution to these drawbacks. Our model combines a Channel and Spatial Feature Fusion Module (CBAM-FF) with a Lightweight Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP) attention mechanism with a MobileNetV3-large backbone. The method can be implemented in field settings with constrained processing capacity thanks to this design, which improves the extraction of deep disease information while lowering computing needs.
